Developed a Java-based console application to handle British currency conversions, demonstrating proficiency in mathematical computation, file I/O, and structured programming. Key features include:
Modern to Old Currency Conversion:
Converted modern British currency into historic denominations (pounds, shillings, and pennies) using precise calculations.
Supported inputs from both user commands and file reading.
File I/O Operations:
Parsed data from input files and extracted monetary values for batch processing.
Processed file data for sequential currency conversion and reporting.
Custom Reporting:
Generated tabular outputs with modern and historic currency side by side for clarity.
Designed output to include labeled columns (L for pounds, s for shillings, d for pennies).
Technical Stack:
Leveraged sheffield.EasyReader and EasyWriter libraries for streamlined input and output handling.
Implemented reusable methods to encapsulate core functionality like conversion logic and reporting.
This project highlights the ability to solve real-world computational problems and present data effectively in user-friendly formats.
